Study of tidal disruption event with the [RICH](https://gitlab.com/eladtan/RICH/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads) simulation, a publicly available moving-mesh hydrodynamics code with radiative transfer.

In parallel, we are developing an I/O package for RICH, named RICHIO. Currently, to install RICHIO, run under the root directory of this repository:

```
pip install -e ./richio
```

and one can import by

```
import richio
```
